            "description": "Making a grand entry has always been a people pleaser. It gives a red carpet feel to everyone who is entering the wedding venue, enthralling them with the spirit of the festivities and setting the vibe of the event. Make your grand entrance even more special by choosing marriage gate decoration themes and styles that are unique and truly one-of-a-kind. You can even take the style quotient up a notch by adding some personalised elements to the marriage gate decoration that reflect your relationship. Add a rustic chic vibe to your marriage gate decoration by making a walk-in tunnel made with white twigs. Spruce up the front of the tunnel walkway by lining it with different colour flowers that match the colours of your venue decoration. Cover the inner roof of the tunnel with dainty fairy lights and the end result you have will be absolutely mystical and magical. Walking under it will feel like walking in a forest under a million start!"

            "description": "A professional wedding photographer is not just an individual you pay ridiculous sums to just flash a camera in your face and eat free kacchi. He/she is a well-seasoned professional, equipped with the best gear to immortalise your memories of how you felt during your wedding versus how it shows in pictures in years to come. So listen carefully to the following advice brought to you by this current bridezilla; those who choose to tread the matrimonial path-- your wedding is not just a milestone in your life (also applicable to those who plan on becoming repeat offenders) and thus, the importance of photographs to preserve those fleeting moments of wedding bliss can, and should never be doubted."

Sunset wedding photography, when the weather permits, is on many photographers’ shot list. The sky is on fire (not literally), the view (if you are at a stunning sunset wedding venue) is breathtaking, and the lighting is simply too good to not take advantage of – there are a lot of reasons why sunset wedding photos are on a wedding photographer and couple’s must-have list. So whether it’s already a part of your shot list and you are looking for some sunset photography tips/inspiration or just need that little push to show you why all that planning and prep is worth it, this blog will help you with both."
